# Contribute to Lightwood

We love to receive contributions from the community and hear your opinions! We want to make contributing to Lightwood as easy as it can be.

Being part of the core Lightwood team is possible to anyone who is motivated and wants to be part of that journey!

Please continue reading this guide if you are interested in helping democratize machine learning.

### Hacktoberfest 2021
If you are participating in this year's Hacktoberfest event, please scroll down to read the relevant guidelines for the event.

## How can you help us?

* Report a bug
* Improve documentation
* Solve an issue
* Propose new features
* Discuss feature implementations
* Submit a bug fix
* Test Lightwood with your own data and let us know how it went!

## Code contributions
In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model) git workflow. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the Lightwood repository
2. Make changes and commit them 
3. Make sure that the CI tests pass. You can run the test suite locally with `flake8 .` to check style and `python -m unittest discover tests` to run the automated tests. This doesn't guarantee it will pass remotely since we run on multiple envs, but should work in most cases.
4. Push your local branch to your fork
5. Submit a pull request from your repo to the `main` branch of `mindsdb/lightwood` so that we can review your changes. Be sure to merge the latest from main before making a pull request!


> Note: You will need to sign a CLI agreement for the code since lightwood is under a GPL license. 

## Feature and Bug reports
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and features. Report them by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/mindsdb/lightwood/issues/new/choose) and fill out all of the required inputs.

## Code review process
Pull request reviews are done on a regular basis. 

If your change has a chance to affecting performance we will run our private benchmark suite to validate it.

Please, make sure you respond to our feedback/questions.
